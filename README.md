## Print All Files

Print All Files is a Python application that allows you to print all of the files in a folder. The application has a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to select the folder that you want to print the files from. Once you have selected the folder, the application will print all of the files in the folder to the default printer.

**To use the application:**

1. Download the application from GitHub: [https://github.com/nickforbizz/DocumentPrinter.git](/nickforbizz/DocumentPrinter).
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.
3. Run the `print_all_files.py` file.
4. In the GUI, select the folder that you want to print the files from.
5. Click the "Print" button.

The application will print all of the files in the folder to the default printer.

**Troubleshooting:**

If you encounter any errors, please check the following:

* Make sure that you have Python installed on your computer.
* Make sure that the folder that you are trying to print the files from is accessible.
* Make sure that the default printer is turned on and has paper loaded.
